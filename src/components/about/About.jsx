          Ever since i was a child, i met my first gaming console sega! Since
          that time i had a lot of communications with computers, like Dial-up
          internet access, cleaning CD-Rom because of compact disc blew up
          suddenlyðŸ˜…. I felt like a true sorcerer, every problem that ocured on
          my way was solved with passion and commitment.As i got older, i tried
          many different occupations. Main goal, was to be happy of my
          craft.World wide web was evolving alongside, i've lost my connection
          with that and was just a simple user. Since last year january i
          decided to rebind interrelation with old friend. I've have joined Full
          Stack Web Development Programm(React and Nodejs majors) at Business
          College Helsinki.It is a full-time 17-months intensive programm, which
          covers Front and Back End. Currently i'm on my finish line to
          graduate, i'm doing my internship at Siciliamia startup.We are using
          React, Material frameworks, firebase and contextApi. Currently i'm
          looking forward to develop myself as a front end professional.{" "}
