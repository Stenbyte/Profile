          Hi there, I'm young 34 years old aspiring Frontend developer. I came
          into this industry because of my big interest and passion for it. And
          I'm extremely happy that I lost my previous job due to Covid-19 and
          was kind of forced to change my career and finally study something I
          have been always dreaming of before. I have completed Full Stack Web
          Development Programm(React and Nodejs majors) at Business College
          Helsinki. It is a full-time 17-months intensive program, which covers
          Front and Back End. When I just started my studies I was a complete
          beginner. My toughest challenge was to digest all the information and
          now when I look at my spare-time projects, broad and serious tasks
          that are being delegated to me during my internship, I have become
          indeed confident of my skills and proud of my achievements. Currently,
          I'm focusing on building full-stack projects using React, Firebase,
          Nodejs, MongoDb, express, Sass, MUI, styled components, and others.
          Please take a look at my projects below.
